# Requirements

Node.js is needed. Current version being used is lts/dubnium (10.x - LTS).

It is recommended to use a version manager for Node.js, like [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm).

With NVM, run the following:

```
$ nvm install
```

This will install the right node version for the project and set it as the current version in use.

# Contributing

To run the project in your machine, run:

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

The server will start at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

# For Windows

- Go to: https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows
- open download link of noinstall and setup: https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases

- run nvm setup
- restart the terminal, and type nvm. Should be displayed for you the version of nvm
- run nvm install v10.15.3-2 on terminal
- run npm install -g docsify-cli on terminal
- go to the filepath of the project on terminal and run npm install and run npm start
